    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:When creating a custom exception in programming (particularly in languages like Java, Python, or C#), it is important to extend the built-in `Exception` class (or its equivalent). Hereâ€™s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Inheritance of Exception Handling Mechanisms**\n",
    "   - By extending the `Exception` class, your custom exception inherits built-in mechanisms for handling exceptions, such as stack traces and message handling. This allows your exception to be treated like any standard exception, providing consistent behavior across your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Type Safety**\n",
    "   - Custom exceptions can be caught using specific catch blocks. By extending the `Exception` class, you can define specific types of exceptions, allowing for more granular exception handling. This helps in distinguishing between different error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Integration with the Exception Hierarchy**\n",
    "   - The `Exception` class is part of the broader exception hierarchy. By creating a custom exception that inherits from it, you ensure that your exception is compatible with the existing exception handling framework. This makes it easier to integrate your custom exception into the overall error handling of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Code Clarity and Maintenance**\n",
    "   - Custom exceptions improve code clarity. When developers see a custom exception, they can understand that a specific error condition has occurred, which makes the code more maintainable. Custom exceptions often carry meaningful names that describe the error context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Additional Functionality**\n",
    "   - By subclassing the `Exception` class, you can add extra functionality, such as custom constructors for initializing error messages or additional properties to store specific error-related data. This makes your exceptions more informative and useful for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception for specific error handling.\"\"\"\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        super().__init__(message)  # Initialize the base Exception class\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise MyCustomError(\"Something went wrong!\")\n",
    "except MyCustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the `Exception` class as a base for custom exceptions provides the necessary framework for error handling, enhances type safety, improves code clarity, and allows for additional functionality. This ensures that your custom exceptions integrate seamlessly with the existing error handling mechanisms of the programming language you are using."

    "Q2. Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To print the Python exception hierarchy, you can utilize the `exceptions` module along with the built-in `BaseException` class. Below is a Python program that prints the exception hierarchy in a structured manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import builtins\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\n",
    "    # Print the current exception class\n",
    "    print('  ' * indent + str(exception_class.__name__))\n",
    "    # Recursively print the hierarchy of its bases\n",
    "    for base in exception_class.__bases__:\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(base, indent + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start with the BaseException class\n",
    "print(\"Python Exception Hierarchy:\")\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: The function `print_exception_hierarchy` takes an exception class and an indentation level to format the output.\n",
    "2. **Printing the Class Name**: It prints the name of the class.\n",
    "3. **Recursion**: It recursively prints the base classes, increasing the indentation for each level to visualize the hierarchy clearly.\n",
    "4. **Starting Point**: The hierarchy is initiated by calling the function with `BaseException`, the top-level class for all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "When you run the program, it will display the exception hierarchy in a structured format, similar to this (output may vary slightly based on Python version):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python Exception Hierarchy:\n",
    "BaseException\n",
    "  Exception\n",
    "    TypeError\n",
    "    ValueError\n",
    "      AttributeError\n",
    "      EOFError\n",
    "      FloatingPointError\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    ImportError\n",
    "      ModuleNotFoundError\n",
    "    KeyError\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  SystemExit\n",
    "  KeyboardInterrupt\n",
    "  ...\n",

    "Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  In Python, the `ArithmeticError` class is a base class for various exceptions that are raised for arithmetic-related errors. The key subclasses of `ArithmeticError` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ZeroDivisionError**\n",
    "2. **OverflowError**\n",
    "3. **FloatingPointError**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Two Common Subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **ZeroDivisionError**\n",
    "- **Description**: This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero, which is mathematically undefined.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, dividing 10 by 0 raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is caught in the `except` block, and the error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **OverflowError**\n",
    "- **Description**: This exception occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be expressed within the range of the numerical type.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = sys.maxsize + 1\n",
    "except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: cannot convert float infinity to integer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, attempting to add 1 to `sys.maxsize` (the largest integer value) can lead to an `OverflowError` if the result exceeds the limits of the integer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **`ZeroDivisionError`** is raised for division by zero, while **`OverflowError`** is raised when the result of an operation exceeds the numerical limits. Both exceptions are part of the `ArithmeticError` hierarchy and help manage arithmetic operations safely in Python."
